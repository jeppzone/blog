Hi there! A very warm welcome to those of you who have found their way here to my little space on the internet. My name is Jesper Olsson Laine, and I'm a Swedish 30-year-old software developer by profession and a health enthusiast by heart. In this blog, I will share experiences from my own health journey, share my thoughts on different health-related subjects and to some extent go through what the research says on said subjects. I'm primarily writing this blog as a learning experience and as a way of documenting my health journey, but I also hope that some of you can find inspiration in the subjects that I write about and the experiences that I share.

To give you some context and background as to why I'm doing this, I have a long history of gut issues, brain fog, feeling lethargic and a myriad of other issues. I have had these problems for the majority of my life, at least since I was like 14 or 15. These issues have been major enough to affect my life negatively, but not severe enough for me to ever really seek help. I kind of though that feeling like this was the norm. That this is the best that I can feel.
