## Introduction
Everybody has heard of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and so on. These are the often mentioned culprits when talking about diseases that are a threat public health. Metabolic syndrome however is less frequently discussed and is lesser known to the public. Metabolic syndrome is a collection of conditions that together increase your risk of developing these diseases. These conditions include
 - High blood pressure (Over 130/85 mmHg) or taking blood presure-lowering medications
 - High blood sugar (Fasting blood sugar level > 100 mg/dL) or taking glucose-lowering medications
 - Excess body fat around the waistline (Waistline >= 40 inches for men, >= 35 inches for women)
 - Abnormal cholesterol (HDL < 40 mg/dL for men, < 50 mg/dL for women) or tryglyceride levels (Trigclyercide > 150 mg/dL) 

Having one of these conditions is bad enough, but can often be managed. Having more than one of these conditions simultaneously will greatly increase the risk of developing any of the aformentioned serious diseases: 
 - Heart attacks
 - Strokes
 - Type 2 diabetes

Metabolic syndrome is alsow known as Insulin resistance syndrome or Syndrome X.

Metabolic syndrome in turn has its own risk factors, the biggest and most serious being insulin resistance, which would explain why it's also called the Insulin resistance syndrome

Insulin resistance means that the body's cell does not respond well to insulin. This leads to glucose staying in the blood stream, leading to high blood sugar, while the cells are deprived of nutrition since insulin is the storage hormone for nutrients. Insulin resistance can be aquired, hereditary or a mixture of both. Risk factors for insulin resistance include
 - Abdominal obesity
 - Physical inactivity
 - Aging
 - Hormonal inbalances
 - Medications
