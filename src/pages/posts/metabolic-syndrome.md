## What is metabolic syndrome?

Everybody has heard of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and so on. These are the often mentioned culprits when talking about diseases that are a threat public health. Metabolic syndrome however is less frequently discussed and is lesser known to the public. Metabolic syndrome is a collection of conditions that together increase your risk of developing these diseases. These conditions include

- High blood pressure or taking blood presure-lowering medications
- High blood sugar or taking glucose-lowering medications
- Excess body fat around the waistline
- Abnormal cholesterol or tryglyceride levels

Having one of these conditions is bad enough, but can often be managed. Having more than one of these conditions simultaneously will greatly increase the risk of developing any of the aformentioned serious diseases:

- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Type 2 diabetes

Metabolic syndrome in turn has its own risk factors, the biggest and most serious being **insulin resistance**, which would explain why it's also called the Insulin resistance syndrome or Syndrome X.

## Insulin resistance

// TODO: Write more about how IR works
Insulin resistance means that the body's cells do not respond well to insulin. This leads to glucose staying in the blood stream, leading to high blood sugar, while the cells are deprived of nutrition since insulin is the storage hormone for nutrients. The body will most likely signal that it's still in need of food even though the person might have just eaten, since a large portion of the nutrients does not reach the cell and is stuck in the blood stream. This will in turn often lead to overeating and indulging in the wrong foods and now we have a vicious cycle since this will worsen the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can be aquired, hereditary or a mixture of both.

#### Risk factors for insulin resistance

Risk factors for insulin resistance include:

- Abdominal obesity
- Physical inactivity
- Hormonal inbalances
- Medications
- Excess consumption of carbohydrates

#### Symptoms of insulin resistance

Symptoms of insulin resistance include, but are not limited to:

- Extreme thirst or hunger
- Feeling hungry even after a meal
- Frequent urination
- Feeling unusually tired
- High blood sugar result on tests

#### Preventing or reversing insulin resistance

There are a lot of remedies mentioned on the internet on what to do for preventing and reversing insulin resistance. I don't agree with all of them, but to sum up, I would focus on exercise in the form of brisk walks and strength training and a low carb diet. I am not a doctor so I can't give medical advice on this, but there are a lot of reserach pointing in this direction. For example, [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34582545/) discussed how a low carb diet showed improvements in insulin resistance. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18171435/) talks about how exercise can increase **insulin sensitivity**, which is the opposite of insulin resistance, both short-term and long-term through repeated exercise.

I will mention insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome a lot in coming posts, which is why I wanted to make this post one of the first on my blog.
