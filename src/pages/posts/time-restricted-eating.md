Concepts like time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting are all the rage right now. 
When I was younger, I had a really strong urge to eat breakfast. I really had to have breakfast within the first 20 minutes of waking up, otherwise I would start to panic. I believed that I would not be able to function at all without eating breakfast. Today, I can eat breakfast whenever I want. Or not at all. It's not unusual for me to skip breakfast and go straight for lunch. Sometimes at 2 or 3 PM. Being awake for a 7-8 hours before eating is now a piece of cake for me. People often say to me that they would never be able to do what I do, skipping breakfast and all that. They feel like they would literally die if the did that. But little do they know, that I used to be exactly like them. If you were to zoom out a little bit, it's very easy to understand that the human body is designed to survive without food for longer periods of time. Food used to be a scarcity. It's not like hunter-gatherers woke up and had a bowl of cheerios for breakfast while downing a litre of orange juice. They oftentimes had to wake up and go hunting for food. This is also why the body is made to perform better when in a fasted state. Because when you're in a fasted state, that means that you will have to go hunting for food, which is a task that requires both mental clarity and physical prowess. Since the body is very smart, we have evolved to perform well in such a state, but it can take some getting used to. Speaking from my own experience, the first week or so when trying intermittent fasting, I did struggle a bit. The feeling of hunger was substantial, but manageable. For each day which I completed my 16 hour fast, it got easier. And I started to notice some benefits.
