## Introduction
Concepts like time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting are all the rage right now. In this post we will dive into time-restricted eating specifically. What is it? What does the research say? What is my experience with it?

## What is time-restricted eating?
First off, what is time-restricted eating? Well, the concept is pretty self-explanatory. It simply means that you eat and drink all your calories within a so-called _feeding window_ every day. A feeding window has a start time and an end time.

For example, a feeding window could be between 11 am and 7 pm. This would be a 10 hour feeding window. The start and end times can vary, as can the length of the window. Different lengths of and start/end time combinations can have different effects.

You may have also heard of the term intermittent fasting. Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting are related concepts, but not entirely equal. The explanation that I usually reach for is that time-restricted eating is a subset of intermittent fasting. While time-restricted eating allows you to have a feeding window every day, other intermittent fasting practices like the 5:2 diet would have you eat normally five days of the week, while restricting your calories the other two. Another intermittent fasting practice could have you fasting an entire day every week, and eating normally the other 6. So intermittent fasting is a much broader term than time-restricted eating. At least that's how I like to see it. This post will only explore the time-restricted eating part of intermittent fasting. Other types of intermittent fasts will be covered in other posts.

## What does the research say?

A lot of studies have been conducted on the effects of time-restricted eating. Some studies show effects, [others don't](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/health/time-restricted-diets.html) 
 - Increased cardiometabolic health for people with metabolic syndrome
 - Weight loss

As with a lot of things health-realted, the only way to find out if something really works for _you_ is to actually try it.

[Some research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28662-5) suggests that an early feeding window is more beneficial with regards to insulin resistance and other metabolic parameters in comparison with a mid-day feeding window. 

## My experience
When I was younger, I had a really strong urge to eat breakfast. I really had to have breakfast within the first 20 minutes of waking up, otherwise I would start to panic. I believed that I would not be able to function at all without eating breakfast. Today, I can eat breakfast whenever I want. Or not at all. It's not unusual for me to skip breakfast and go straight for lunch. Sometimes at 2 or 3 PM. Being awake for a 7-8 hours before eating is now a piece of cake for me. People often say to me that they would never be able to do what I do, skipping breakfast and all that. They feel like they would literally die if the did that. But little do they know, that I used to be exactly like them. If you were to zoom out a little bit, it's very easy to understand that the human body is designed to survive without food for longer periods of time. Food used to be a scarcity. It's not like hunter-gatherers woke up and had a bowl of cheerios for breakfast while downing a litre of orange juice. They oftentimes had to wake up and go hunting for food. This is also why the body is made to perform better when in a fasted state. Because when you're in a fasted state, that means that you will have to go hunting for food, which is a task that requires both mental clarity and physical prowess. Since the body is very smart, we have evolved to perform well in such a state, but it can take some getting used to. Speaking from my own experience, the first week or so when trying time-restricted eating, I did struggle a bit. The feeling of hunger was substantial, but manageable. For each day which I completed my 16 hour fast, it got easier. And I started to notice some benefits.
